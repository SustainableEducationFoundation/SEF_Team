I'm Kalpani Ranasinghe, the Secretary of Sustainable Education Foundation and I’m currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Science (honors) in Software Engineering degree at University of Colombo School of Computing. And I have successfully completed CIMA Operational Level. 

My interested areas are Machine Learning and Game development. Meanwhile, I have been involved with some interesting machine learning, image processing, web development and game development projects. And I'm a blog writer and I write articles related to computer science, software engineering and also my thoughts.

When it comes to the community works, I have contributed for many societies of the University of Colombo School of computing and I have volunteered for many communities outside the university, for the past two and half years.  

Within those years, one of the best things happens to me is Rails Girls Summer of Code 2017. I was a member of one of the sponsored team and our team was the first Sri Lankan team in Rails Girls Summer of Code Program. And I have participated in many Inter-University Hackathons and competitions: such as HackX 2017, Shecoderess v1.0, Hacktitude 2017, Hackaholics v2.0, Inter-university Karate championships and have won awards to make my alma mater proud.

I have started to learn about IT and related things, for about two and half years ago and I’m honestly proud of what I’m today since I came from a non-technical background and I haven’t learned IT for my O/L’s, A/L’s or before.

At the end of the day, I'm a friendly, down to earth, a trustworthy girl who loves to draw animes and play karate.  Apart from all of these things, I really want to help the children out there who are struggling to win the education competition and make their lives beautiful and better with the collaboration of the sustainable education foundation.
