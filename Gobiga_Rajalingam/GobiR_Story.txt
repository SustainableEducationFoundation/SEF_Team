I’m Gobiga Rajalingam, Assistant Secretary at the Sustainable Education Foundation and a second year ICT undergraduate in Rajarata University of Sri Lanka (RUSL). In addition to that, I am a Secretariat member at the IEEE Innovation Nation Sri Lanka 2018, a technical writer at GGSLK, a blogger, a random volunteer in various events and an avid participator in every hackathon event happening around Sri Lanka. 
My interest in IT started soon after I was selected for the Bachelor of Science in ICT degree and since then, I haven’t looked back. I’m still learning the nuances in IT and my interests include, Machine learning, Mobile application development, UI/UX designing, Computer Vision, IoT among others. Generally, I call myself a learner and I’m tended towards trying my hand at everything regardless my interest in them. Besides, I’m a technical writer and a content creator and I often utilize and hone these skills through my volunteering experience. 
Thus far, I’ve been a part of few computer vision and IoT based projects and I’ve participated and volunteered in numerous hackathons, meetups and events since I was exposed to the Tech world and that list is too long to be mentioned here. 
Being a part of such reputed organizations with talented colleagues has moulded me into the person that I’m right now. Especially my involvement with the Sustainable Education Foundation gave me the exposure into the Industry and provided me with opportunities with which I am able to thrive through learning and trying new aspects of professionalism.
One of the best things I did was to apply for the SEF, which is itself striving to make quality education available to everyone and it’s quite a thing to remember forever that I’m playing a part in bringing the opportunities available to all.
